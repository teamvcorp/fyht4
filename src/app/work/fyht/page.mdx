## Overview

In an effort to create a more balanced and inclusive community, we implement a simple process that gives equal voting power to individuals of all income levels. This ensures that every voice is heard—regardless of wealth—when it comes to shaping the direction of our shared future. By separating financial status from influence, we allow every member of society to contribute ideas and solutions on equal footing. The money collected through voluntary contributions is then used to create positive, community-driven change based on the collective voice, not just the loudest or richest.
