I have always had a passion for creating simple, satisfying food combinations that bring people joy. I am thrilled to partner with FYHT4, not only to continue doing what I love—cooking—but also to serve my local community and support those in need. This program is a powerful opportunity to combine purpose with passion, and I am honored to be a part of it.
