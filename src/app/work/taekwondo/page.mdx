## Overview

FYHT4 integrates **Taekwondo**, **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)**, and **Homeschool Plus** into a single wellness-education system. Taekwondo develops discipline, movement quality, and self-control; ABA translates goals into daily micro-habits; and Homeschool Plus lets families tailor academics and life skills with community input. Together, students build **emotional regulation**, **mental clarity**, and **physical capacity**—and families get a clear, supportive framework for growth.
